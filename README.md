# Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for Twelve Radios  
John Cage 
New York, 1951  
Imaginary Landscape No. 4 is scored for manipulate short-wave (or AM) radios. The score is precise in its timings, and in specifying the volume and tuning settings for each of the 12 radios. What he could not specify, and had no desire to, were the actual sounds to be produced. Because the sounds are created from the ether, from whatever radio signals happen to be picked up in that particular place and that particular time, the piece will sound different each and every time it is performed. The general character will remain the same however: snatches of music and speech, along with static and other noises.

# 2- Stage Transfer Drawing ( Advancing to a Future State)  
Dennis Oppenheim, 1971-1972  
A parent draws a picture on child's back. And child imitates that picture by only his sense of touch of back. Because child is parent offspring, and they share similar biological ingredients, parent's back (as surface) can be seen as a mature version of child's own...in a sense, he contacts  his own future state.

# THE TRACE  
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer
Madrid, 1995  
The main objective of THE TRACE is to allow the two remote participants to have them occupy identical positions in telematic space. This is done using real-time audiovisual events that reconstruct the three-dimensional presence of each participant in the space of the other. Each station consists of a dark room with a giant rear-projection screen on the ceiling, a side monitor, four robot-lamps hanging from the ceiling and ten speakers distributed around the room.

inTouch is a project to explore new forms of interpersonal communication through touch. Force-feedback technology is employed to create the illusion that people, separated by distance, are interacting with a shared physical object. The “shared” object provides a haptic link between geographically distributed users, opening up a channel for physical expression over distance.

# Freequent Traveller  
Susanne Schuricht and Tobias Schmidt 
Berlin Germany, 2002  
The interface consists of a hammock, whose movement is tracked by a custom-made hardware interface. The dynamics of projected text animation are perceived as intricately synchronized with, and connected to ones own bodily movement together with the hammock. The texts are short essays and excerpts about technology, mobility, home and identity. The installation is an instrument to generate contemplation and change in outlook.

# Remote Piano  
Koichiro Eto, Toshio Iwai, Ryuichi Sakamoto
Tokyo, 1996  
The Internet audience will be able to "play" the piano (Remote Piano) via their web browser. Any user will be able to offer their own piano performances in an interactive "session" with Sakamoto. These special features demonstrate the Internet's true strength as a two-way medium, and further Sakamoto's desire to tear down musical, technological and social boundaries.

# Network Performing Arts Production Workshop 2018  
Miami, 2018  
The Network Performing Arts Production Workshop (NPAPW) is an annual gathering of artists, students, academic administrators and technologists exploring the use of interactive media in arts education and performance. Classic American theatre takes center stage at the New World Symphony to kick off NPAPW2018, but in a very nontraditional way. Two players, one in Miami and one in Tampere, Finland perform together on a virtual stage made possible by the Nimbra system and advanced networks.
